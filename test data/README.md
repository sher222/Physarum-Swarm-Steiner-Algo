Presented in this folder is the test data used in our paper. A description of the test cases can be found in dataDescription.md.

###Computer environment and software
For our paper, we ran all tests using Amazon Web Services (AWS) Batch. Each machine used a modified [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/sher222/span_tree) that essentially consisted of our algorithm java file loaded onto the publicly available amazonlinux image.
