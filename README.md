# Physarum-Swarm-Steiner-Algo
Source code for The Power of Many: A Physarum Steiner Tree Algorithm

Code implements ideas from the following papers: 
* Sheryl Hsu, Fidel I. Schaposnik Massolo, Laura P. Schaposnik. The Power of Many: A Physarum Steiner Tree Algorithm, 2021. https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.08233
* Sheryl Hsu and Laura P. Schaposnik. Cell fusion through slime mold network dynamics. Manuscript submitted for publication, 2021. https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11371
* Y. Gunji, Y.-P. Gunji, T. Shirakawa, T. Niizato, and T. Haruna, “Minimal model of a cell connecting amoebic motion andadaptive transport networks,” Journal of Theoretical Biology, pp. 659 – 667, 2008.

Three implementations are provided: the standard algorithm which works on both rectangles and squares, an obstacle avoidance implementation, and finally a implementation to find Steiner trees on a torus. Sample grids and boundaries are provided in grids.
